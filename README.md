# ABM-information-diffusion
This repository includes all the code for Mads and Martin's Master Thesis. 

The project is about developing (with existing tools) an Agent Based Model of information diffusion in a social network. 
We want to investigate how real news and fake news influence agents choice of recieving the vaccine for Covid-19 or not. 

We are investigating this through Multiscale systems, information diffusion theory, based on an Agent Based Model. 
Agents in the system include commoner, fake news influencer and real news influencer.
